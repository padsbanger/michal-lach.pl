  <h1>About</h1>
  <div class="desc">
    <p>My name is <strong>Micha≈Ç Lach</strong> and I am 23 years old. I am a <strong>front-end developer</strong> from Gdynia, Poland.</p>
    <p>As a graduate of Internet Technology with <strong>3 years</strong> commercial experience working in various web related roles in a front end development.</p>

    <p>I create websites that allow the user to experience your website in the best and most appropriate way suited to the device they are using. By working using <strong>progressive enhancement</strong>, a website is delivered with a responsive layout that can best make use of the space available on the smallest to largest devices. <strong>Cross browser compatibility</strong> is ensured by using feature detection so older browsers still in use today provide a solid experience, whilst modern browsers can go the next step and enhance the users time spent on your site.
    </p>
    <p>Writing <strong>semantic markup</strong> that is documented and easy to read means it can be maintained and scaled in the future, and allows co-workers to quickly pick it up.</p>

    <p>For many projects I rely on tools and open-source libraries such as jQuery, AngularJS, LESS, Git, Grunt, Bower, and Modernizr. I also create <strong>my own tools</strong>, boilerplates and share them on <a href="https://github.com/padsbanger">Github</a>.</p>
